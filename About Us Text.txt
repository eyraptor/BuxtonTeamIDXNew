We are Brent & Edna Buxton, owners of the Buxton Team with Keller Williams Realty Platinum. The Buxton Team has been helping Oklahomans move since 2012. The Buxton Team helps our clients through the entire home buying and selling process so it is as smooth as possible. We know it is important to have a real estate agent you trust so we take time to meet with you in person so you can interview us and know if we are the right Realtors for you. 

Our philosophy is simple: we will start by meeting with you in person and learning what your wants and needs are. Then we will put together a personalized plan and timetable with you so you know what to expect throughout the entire process. We will be with you all the way whether you are selling or buying a home. Best of all, we will explain each step, and what you should expect so you wonâ€™t have a bunch of unwanted surprises. 

If this sounds like the experience you want when buying or selling a home, or you know anyone who is looking to buy or sell a home in the OKC, Piedmont, Yukon, Edmond, and Deer Creek area, reach out to us and we will give you and your friends the special care you deserve. Just give us a call at 405-345-6012 and set up your first meeting with us.
