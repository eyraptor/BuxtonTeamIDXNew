          <p>We are Brent & Edna Buxton, owners of the Buxton Team with LRE Realty. The Buxton Team has been helping Oklahomans move since 2012. The Buxton Team helps our clients through the entire home buying and selling process so it is as smooth as possible. We know it is important to have a real estate agent you trust so we take time to meet with you in person so you can interview us and know if we are the right Realtors for you.</p><br />
          
          <p>Our philosophy is simple: we will start by meeting with you in person and learning what your wants and needs are. Then we will put together a personalized plan and timetable with you so you know what to expect throughout the entire process. We will be with you all the way whether you are selling or buying a home. Best of all, we will explain each step, and what you should expect so you won’t have a bunch of unwanted surprises.</p><br />
          
          <p>If this sounds like the experience you want when buying or selling a home, or you know anyone who is looking to buy or sell a home in the OKC, Piedmont, Yukon, Edmond, and Deer Creek area, reach out to us and we will give you and your friends the special care you deserve. Just give us a call at 405-345-6012 and set up your first meeting with us.</p>

                remembering to leave reviews, but they are so great that here it is 2 years after they helped us buy our
                first house and I still felt the need to write a review! We were first time home-buyers and did not
                understand the process very well. They took the time to explain everything thoroughly and made sure we
                understood the process. They were always willing to make time for us, even taking us to see a house 3 times!
                I have absolute certainty that the Buxton Team can and will handle anything that you need, so do not
                hesitate andgive them a call today!<br /><br />

              <p class='testimonial-font-size'>My husband and I were shopping around for our first home when we were
                recommended to Edna and Brent Buxton. It was truly
                a blessing have realtors like them. Not only did they act as our Realtors, but they also filled the roles of
                parents, mentors, financial advisors, and even counselors to us (they helped us deal with the stress of
                buying a home as newlyweds.) They helped us navigate a crazy, competitive market and truly showed us that
                they had our best interest in mind. We can happily say we finally closed on a house and we couldn’t have
                done it without the two of them!! They are the best Realtors in Oklahoma City. If you have the chance to
                work with them, I would go for it! We will be recommending them to all our friends and anyone looking to buy
                a home in the future.<br /><br />
