                  bad at remembering to leave reviews, but they are so great that here it is 2 years after they helped
                  us buy our first house and I still felt the need to write a review! We were first time home-buyers and
                  did not understand the process very well. They took the time to explain everything thoroughly and made
                  sure we understood the process. They were always willing to make time for us, even taking us to see a
                  house 3 times! I have absolute certainty that the Buxton Team can and will handle anything that you
                  need, so do not hesitate andgive them a call today!<br /><br />

                <h4>It was truly a blessing have realtors like them.</h4>
                <p class='testimonial-font-size'>My husband and I were shopping around for our first home when we were
                  recommended to Edna and Brent Buxton. It was truly
                  a blessing have realtors like them. Not only did they act as our Realtors, but they also filled the
                  roles of parents, mentors, financial advisors, and even counselors to us (they helped us deal with the
                  stress of buying a home as newlyweds.) They helped us navigate a crazy, competitive market and truly
                  showed us that they had our best interest in mind. We can happily say we finally closed on a house and
                  we couldnâ€™t have done it without the two of them!! They are the best Realtors in Oklahoma City. If you
                  have the chance to work with them, I would go for it! We will be recommending them to all our friends
                  and anyone looking to buy a home in the future.<br /><br />
